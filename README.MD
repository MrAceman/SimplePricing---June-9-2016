## Simple Pricing CSS project - Normal Mode

This HTML and CSS was created over the weekend of June 10th through June 12th, 2016.  The goal was to take the screenshot file provided by Brit and generate the HTML and CSS needed to replicate the normal-mode.png screenshot provided.

The primary purposes of this exercise were to work on planning out screen layout using divs, etc. along with utilizing properties like float, display (relative and absolute).  Basic properties such as margin, padding, etc. were permitted.  Use of display:inline-block or flex block were not allowed.
